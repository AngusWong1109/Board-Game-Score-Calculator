Scoring system:
	A good score is an expected good score (not the best!) for a game
	A bad score is an expected bad score (not the worst!) for a game

Creating games and game types:
	When creating a new game, the expected scores for good and bad score are per player.
	When creating a new game play, the expected score is CUMULATIVE for all players, your achievement level is based on the cumulative score, scaled by
	the number of players who played the game.
